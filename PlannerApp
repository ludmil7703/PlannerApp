You can install maven and run the compile directly in the build. Typically this would be a multi-stage build to avoid including the entire jdk in your pushed image:

FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine as build
RUN apk add --no-cache maven
WORKDIR /java
COPY . /java
RUN mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom","-jar","/java/target/myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]
